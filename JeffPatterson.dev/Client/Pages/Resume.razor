    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    I have written applications in C# using various commercial and OSS frameworks
    to access databases, communicate with in-house and third-party industrial
    equipment, and control motion. I am comfortable using other languages to
    control machinery, robots, and vision inspection systems. As part of the
    project deliverables, I created documentation for the program operation and
    troubleshooting procedures. I have successfully managed controls projects for
    automated machinery in various applications and industries such as
    Automotive, Consumer Electronics, Medical Devices, and Consumer Healthcare.
    These projects had a sale price of $500K–$1.5M and included implementing
    computer information systems, data collection, and a wide assortment of
    control technologies. All designs meet government standards and regulations
    and industry specifications such as the NFPA79, 70, and 70E and any
    additional specifications that the customer would require. Additionally,
    there are times when the equipment is required to meet UL and CE
    certifications before customer acceptance.

  <h2>Employment History</h2>
  <h3>Application Developer</h3>
  <strong>Eurofins Jun ’21 – Present</strong>
  <br />
  At Eurofins, I work with a diverse group of developers in Des Moines, France,
  Costa Rica, and India. I am part of a team of backend developers that create
  and maintain services that support the primary desktop application used by
  partner labs throughout the United States and Canada—writing in C# using Visual
  Studio to produce web services. The backend software accesses data stored in
  SQL Server databases and MongoDb. Additionally, we have an Azure cloud
  application used by third-party customers of a partner lab that I routinely
  update and maintain that runs on several cloud VMs and uses Azure SQL.

  <h3>Controls Engineer</h3>
  <strong>Accumold Jul ’17 – June ‘21</strong>
  <p>
    Build Vision Inspection applications for measuring the quality of parts
    produced. Program and maintain custom micro injection molding machines.
    Integrate purchased equipment with equipment designed and built in-house.
    Mentor junior members of the department and help them learn controls
    programming.
  </p>
  Career Highlights
  <ul>
    <li>
      I recently designed and programmed a multi-camera PC-based vision inspection system using C#, Halcon, EFCore, Prism, ReactiveX, SQLite, and OPCUA.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built and maintain a Windows desktop application to create and store machine recipes in a central database. The original system managed all recipes locally on each machine which meant lots of duplication and no change management. This project uses C#, SQL Server, WPF, EFCore, and the Prism library.
    </li>
    <li>
      I created and maintained a machine security login system for user access to machine computers that were not domain-joined. This project included a separate desktop application with C#, SQL Server, and WPF for user maintenance and security assignments using an RFID reader and writer, EF6, and access via security group from AD to limit access to production supervisors.
